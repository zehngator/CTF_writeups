## IT Engineer Extorting Former Employer
&nbsp; In August a IT Engineer by the name of Daniel Rhyne was arrested for attempting to extort his former employer for 750,000 dollars. He was discovered as the culprit  via traceback digital forensics.

**The Crime**  
&nbsp; The vulnerablity the criminal exploited was the fact that he still had admin privleges on the system. This made it easy for him to:  

> Changed the company administrator password  
> Deleted 13 domain administrator accounts  
> Changed passwords to 301 domain user accounts  
> Changed passwords to two local admin accounts, locking down 254 servers  
> Changed passwords to two local admin accounts, impacting 3284 workstations  
> Shut down “several” servers and workstations over a few days in December 2023  

He then threatened shut of 40 servers a day untill the ransom was paid. To do this he logged into the company network from his personal laptop and logged into an administrator account. The impact is dire for the company nearly losing all of there data due to the attack.

**The Capture**  
&nbsp;In order to catch Rhyne instead of using a vulnerablity they simply combed through the logs and tracedback various vms and IPs. While going through the logs they found that an IP form his house in New Jersey logged into the companies network a few minutes before the administrator account, that did the damage, was logged into multiple times. When futher inestigating the changed accounts they discovered that many of the new account passwords were the same a Rhyne's. Finally when they traced back the remote desktop session they found the vm used also had inciminating google seaches before the extortion began. The impact of being able to traceback logs of crimes commited is very positive allowing cyber criminal to be found easily if they do not cover there traces.

**Mitigations**  
&nbsp; Mitigations aginst the criminal inculde ensuring once you fire someone or remove them from your network they do not have unauthorized access to your network, especially to remote desktop. This is encompassed in the idea of only giving people the minimal privleges needed to complete their job.  
&nbsp; Mitigations aginst the people capturing the criminal would be to cover your tracks better. Using a vpn to hide your true location to not be tracked back to your house. Not searching up how to do the explotation on the same computer as you intend on doing the explotation. When changing passwords on a system do not change them to your password giving a huge sign that you did the attack.
