## CTF: Forensics AY25
Challenge: endianness-v2 

Category:  forensics

Points:

Difficulty:  Intermediate

## Instructions
Here's a file that was recovered from a 32-bits system that organized the bytes a weird way. We're not even sure what type of file it is.  
Download it [here](https://gitlab.usna.edu/cyberopsmidncourses/sy421/ay-2025-fall/zehnder/-/blob/main/forensics/forensics04/challengefile?ref_type=heads) and see what you can get out of it

## Solution
I need to find out what type of file it is
* It is data

Gotta figure out how to read it and get the flag

I think the file bytes may be flipped around.  
* Theres alot of 80s which are 1s in start of heading in ascii   
After flipping the binary of the file using the [code](reversesol.py) i am left with a  
> [OpenPGP Public Key](newfile)

Trying to use the public key it did not work so I had chatgpt make me a [code](chatgptsolver.py)  to do it to in case i messed it up
* The result gave me [this file](reversed.asc)  
* after comparing them I have discovered that I accidently put the bytes in there twice

Now I have to see how to interact with the file using gpg
* tried to use:

        gpg --import revsered.asc  
        gpg --armor --export revsered.asc  
        gpg  revsered.asc  

* when trying to do anyting with the key nothing worked and only gave errors

I think that the openpgp Public key was a **trap**

I reversed the binary in the file off of 32 bit using this [code](Chatgpt2.py), made by chatgpt, since it talked about a 32 bit system and it resulted in this image

[image](https://gitlab.usna.edu/cyberopsmidncourses/sy421/ay-2025-fall/zehnder/-/blob/main/forensics/forensics04/plzwork?ref_type=heads) It is a jifif and won't open in the README.md

The image was a photo of the flag which was: 

* picoCTF{cert!f1Ed_iNd!4n_s0rrY_3nDian_76e05f49}


All i gotta say making the binary appear as a public key was mean and wasted alot of time

## Flag
picoCTF{cert!f1Ed_iNd!4n_s0rrY_3nDian_76e05f49}

## Mitigation
You can store your information is a place that is more secure and use an actual encryptions. If you just change it a few ways eventually someone is gonna guess how you changed it. It is better to hide via known virtually unbreakable algorithms then via personal secrets.
