## Solution  
First I tried opening the file with cat  
* When I cated the file this popped up in the cat

n#('&u
ehp i c o C T F { p 4 c k 3 7 _ 5 h 4 r k _ b 9 d 5 3 7 6 5 }
k&NaaB''E4g@@

Extracting the flag:  
picoCTF{p4ck37_5h4rk_b9d53765}

I tried out some tools after to see how inspecting works
* I used tcpdump with the command:
    tcpdump -r network-dump.flag.pcap -A

This printed out the ascii of all the packets including the flag


## Flag

picoCTF{p4ck37_5h4rk_b9d53765}

## Mitigation
Do not send vlauable information (ie. flags, keys, PPI) on unencrypted traffic. If the message was encrypted before it was sent I would of not been able to get the flag as easily and possibly not even realize it was a flag. As long as both sides know how to decrypt the message the conversation may be a little slower but worth the security.
