## Saflok door locks  
Relased earlier this year, in 2022 hackers were able to discover a way to revserse engineer the code that generates the RFID of the key card for a specific room. This allowed them to create a copy of the RFID of any room with a Saflok lock on it.

## UnSalok
The hackers have named this technique they used Unsalok after the type of lock it is able to unlock. The vulrablites Unsalok uses is the weakness of Dormakaba's(comapny that makes Saflok locks) encryption as well as the RFID system they use. In the RFID system there has been known vulrablites for over a decade that allow people to write RFID keys. 

## Reverse Engineering
The peice that maked the exploit possible was the revserse engineering of the lock programming devices. After obtaining a lock programer from a hotel they were able to discover what data was being contained on the keys. From there they found out the encryption is based off of a room code and property code. From there they figured out how to copy Dormakaba's encrypting, which allowed them to be able to make a key for any room that uses a Saflok lock by just using the property code and room code.

## Impact
This vulrablity has a huge impact on hotels world wide with over 13,000 property in 113 countries using them. Due to the severity of the impact is why the report came out 2 years later as Dormakaba is still trying to find ways to remedy the incident with in all its clients hotels.

## Mitigations
One mitigation Dormakaba could have done was keeping the lock programming device more secretive. The article said the hackers simply asked a few people before someone handed it over to them. This is a less realistic mitigation due to the size of comapny and the need for hotels to program their locks. Another mitigation would be for Dormakaba to use a more secure encryption technique for the keys. One way they could do this would be by making the lock programer communicate to Dormakaba everytime they are making a key and encrypting it based off of a sha key held by Dormakaba and the hotel.
