3. Read the flag
## Flag

picoCTF{a.moose.once.bit.my.sister}

## Mitigation
While it is good practice to log everything that happens in the code you should make sure that any secret or flag is not loged in plaintext. As if it is loged in plain text it can be easily seen by anyone who trys to debugg the code.
