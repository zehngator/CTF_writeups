[binary](out)

## Solution
I need to find out how to read linux executalbe binary 

When catting it there is just alot of text and nothing of values that I can see immediatly 

I ran the file command:  
file out          
out: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, no section header

When attempting to use:   
objdump -d out                  
out:     file format elf64-x86-64

Was the only output

I am going to try to use gdb first need to find entry point

use: 
 objdump -f out 

out:     file format elf64-x86-64  
architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000102:  
EXEC_P, D_PAGED  
start address 0x000000000044ade0  

entry point: 0x000000000044ade0

After looking at the hint and trying to compress it with upx it said it was already compressed so I'm going to try to uncompress it:  

    upx -d out

This made the file much longer and when using strings out there are words vice jibberish

I then used less and searched for buz words:
* pico = nothing
* flag = password?

strings out | grep flag  
Password correct, please see flag: 7069636f4354467b5539585f556e5034636b314e365f42316e34526933535f62646438343839337d  
(mode_flags & PRINTF_FORTIFY) != 0  
WARNING: Unsupported flag value(s) of 0x%x in DT_FLAGS_1.  
version == NULL || !(flags & DL_LOOKUP_RETURN_NEWEST)  
flag.c  
_dl_x86_hwcap_flags  
_dl_stack_flags  

It was not the password  
It was the flag in hex to convert:  

echo  7069636f4354467b5539585f556e5034636b314e365f42316e34526933535f62646438343839337d | xxd -r -p  

picoCTF{U9X_UnP4ck1N6_B1n4Ri3S_bdd84893}  

## Flag

picoCTF{U9X_UnP4ck1N6_B1n4Ri3S_bdd84893} 
 
## Mitigation
In order to slow people down from finding the key the binary could of been stripped taking away all the unneccessary words. This way the flag could not be found with buzz words.
