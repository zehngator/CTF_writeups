## CTF: [Reverse Engineering] [Fall AY25]
Challenge: 

Category:   RE

Points:

Difficulty:  Intermediate

## Instructions
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Download the assembly dump here.

## Solution

<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
    #setting up the sat

<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rsi


<+15>:    mov    eax,0x30

return 0x30
return 48

#epilog
<+20>:    pop    rbp
<+21>:    ret
