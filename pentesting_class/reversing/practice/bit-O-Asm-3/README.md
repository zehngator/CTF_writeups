## CTF: [Reverse Engineering] [Fall AY25]
Challenge: 

Category:   RE

Points:

Difficulty: [ Introductory | Intermediate

## Instructions
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Download the assembly dump here.

## Solution
need to look at code 



<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
#prolog

<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi argc 
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi arv

#makes 2 vars
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x9fe1a 
<+22>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x4

#moves first var into eax
<+29>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]

#multiplies integers
<+32>:    imul   eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]

#adds the integers
<+36>:    add    eax,0x1f5
<+41>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
<+44>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]

#epilog
<+47>:    pop    rbp
<+48>:    ret
