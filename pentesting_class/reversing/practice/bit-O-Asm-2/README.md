Category:   RE

Points:

Difficulty: [ Introductory | Intermediate

## Instructions
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Download the assembly dump here.

## Solution
need to look at code 


<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp


<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi agrc
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi   argv

#meat and potatoes
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
#pointing to 0x9fe1a number 

#moves above number to eax
<+22>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]


<+25>:    pop    rbp
<+26>:    ret
