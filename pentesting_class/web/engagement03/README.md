## CTFi: PICO Web Fall25 
Challenge: Forbidden Paths

Category: web

Points:

Difficulty:   Intermidiate  

## Instructions

Can you get the flag?
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Solution

When typing in a solutions and pressing submit it brings you to a new page that says file not found with a url of

    http://saturn.picoctf.net:54385/read.php

So I typed in read.php into the text box and got this back

    $firstChar = $_POST['filename'][0];

if( strcmp($firstChar, '/') == 0 )
{
echo "Not Authorized";
}
else
{
if (file_exists($_POST['filename'])) {

$file = fopen($_POST['filename'], 'r');

while(! feof($file))
{
$line = fgets($file);
echo $line. "
";
}

fclose($file);
} else {
echo "File does not exist";
}
}
?>

Tried to change the cookie to make it so the payload sent was /usr/shar/nginx/html/flag.txt (find.sh)  
But it just returned not autorized 
The file is php there for possibly php injection attck?
