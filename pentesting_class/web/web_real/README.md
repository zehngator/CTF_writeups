## SolarWinds Web Help Desk 
&nbsp; In mid August of this year SolarWinds had a critical level cyber threat to their systems. This threat came in the form of a hard coded credential within the SolarWinds help desk. Which was quickly fixed with an update after it was brought to attention.

**Hard Coded credentials**  
&nbsp; When a system has hard coded credentials the system is left very vulnerable. As having the credentials hardcoded into the system means that somewhere in the code the creds can be found and extracted by an attacker giving them unauthorized access to a system.

**Impact**  
&nbsp; This vulnerability allows attackers to access internal functionalities and modify data they are not authorized to change. There is little information so far at this time about the impact it has made as the attack happened so recently. But, theorizing what could have been done can range anywhere from attackers being able to muddle with various companies using SolarWinds technology if the creds lead to access to the main SolarWinds network. Or just allowing the attackers to listen in on peoples questions across the help desk is the creds belonging just to help desk access. But, With the severity of the vulnerability being labeled a 9.1 the former seems to be more likely.

**Mitigations**  
&nbsp; Possible mitigations for hardcoded credentials is to change the architecture of the credentials. Putting the creds into encrypted files outside of the code allows for much more secure credential storage. If the system requires hard coded credentials in the system then they could limit the access the hard coded credentials have. Overall it is rather surprising that SolarWinds had such a simple mistake in the help desk as they are a software management company.
