## CTFi: PICO Web Fall25 
Challenge: WebDecode

Category: web

Points:

Difficulty:   Introductory 

## Instructions

Do you know how to use the web inspector?

Hints:
1. Hfr gur jro vafcrpgbe ba bgure svyrf vapyhqrq ol gur jro cntr.
2. Gur synt znl be znl abg or rapbqrq

## Solution

Inspect all the pages.

Found interesting line:

>section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9"
>
>**cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9**

Could the long jumble of charatcters be the key?

>No

But decoded it could be!

1. Roll 13 gives nothing interesting

2. But base 64 does by using:

> echo cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9 | base64 -d
>
>returns: 
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_df0da727}        

Before I tried to decoded it I spent way to much time looking way to deep by inspecting all the links in the source code to find nothing for a while.

## Flag

picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_df0da727}        

## Mitigation

Do not leave enocoded flags in your html file when you make a website.
