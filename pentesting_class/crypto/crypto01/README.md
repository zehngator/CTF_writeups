## CTF: Cryptographic Analysis Fall AY25

Difficulty: Introductory

## Instructions

Hint:  
1. Engaging in various decoding processes is of utmost importance

## Solution
I was given a file named [enc_flag](enc_flag) which contains the text  
> YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyeG9OakJzTURCcGZRPT0nCg==

Given the name of the file and the fact its a crypto challenge I am going to try to unencrypt it  

        echo "YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyeG9OakJzTURCcGZRPT0nCg==" | base64 -d

Which gave the output

        b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2xoNjBsMDBpfQ=='

When trying to decode again in base64 it was an invalid input

Try to do a ceaser cyphier:

I went though every variation both with a just alphabet and alpha numeric on code chef and found no useful combination 



I then went down the list of decoding options under monoalphabetic sub ciphers in crypto coner where I found no useable outputs

I then googled about == at the end and found out it still might be a base 64 that needs to be decoded. After getting rid of b'' and the I ran the code

        base64 -d flagfinder2             

[flagfinder2](flagfinder2) was the result of the first decryption without the b''  
and got 

        wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_lh60l00i}

Now it looks like a ceaser cipher

When putting it in ROT13 Brute Force on cyber chef I was left with:

> Amount = 19: picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_ea60e00b}

## Flag

picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_ea60e00b}

## Mitigation

Don't use the same encryption 2 times in a row espeaccily one that end with ==.
