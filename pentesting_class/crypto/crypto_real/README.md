## jsrsasign RSA decryption [CVE-2024-21484] 
&nbsp; Jsrsasign is a free open source crypto library used to encrypt files and is very popular with over a million downloads a month. But in january of this year there was a vulnrblity that was publihed about how files encrypted by this libray can be decrypted. 

**Decrypting**  
&nbsp; The soucre of the problem allowing the decrypting is the Marvin security flaw which uses timing of various aspects of encryption such as server response time to decrypt a RSA key. In order to do this the attacker needs a large number of encrypted messages that were encrypted by the same key. 

**Impact**  
&nbsp; This vulnrblity is labeled as a high security threat by the CVE. With how many people use the jsrsasign this could have a large impact allowing people to find the key to valuable information that was encrypted with RSA. Right now it is at the stage of proof of concept meaning that they know it is possilbe and has been done before. This espescally has a large impact on smaller buisnesses and individuals who don't have access to none opensource cryto libraries as jsrsasignis one of the largest opensource libraries.

**Mitigation**
&nbsp; Mitigation for this attack is rather simple for the most part. With the requirement of a large number of files encrypted with the same key someone could always use multiple keys making sure not to repeat the same ones to often. Another fix is to use RSAOAEP encryption instead of jsut RSA on jsrsasignis. The main people who are in danger of the attack are people who already have a large amount of files stored that are encrypted by the same key.
