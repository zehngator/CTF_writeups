## CTF: Cryptographic Analysis Fall AY25
Challenge: transpositoin-trail 

Category: crypto

Points:

Difficulty:  Intermediate

## Instructions
Our data got corrupted on the way here. Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message.
Download the corrupted message here.

## Solution
The message that was in the file is:  
> heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V091B0AE}2

It says that the message got scrambeled in 3 letter blocks I just have to find how it was scrabled to reverse it.

It appears tht the letters need to shift down with a rolling effect to bring the last on to the front.

I wrote a [code](solver.py) the unscambled all of the string

        #!/usr/bin/python3

        st = "heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V091B0AE}2"
        count = 0
        awn = ""
        for i in range(0,len(st)-1,3):
                awn += st[i+2] + st[i] + st[i+1] 

        print(awn)

The output was:  

        The flag is picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_109AB02E}



## Flag

picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_109AB02E}

## Mitigation
Make the proper order of the key harder to figureout so making the solving code would be harder. Or add another layer of encryption so even if they know it needs to be shifted they do not know to shift before or after or how much to.
