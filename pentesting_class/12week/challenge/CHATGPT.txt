Used Chat gpt to write a code that pulled the mac address and checked it against a set mac address to make the code only run on one computer.

how to make a code only be able to run on one computer

To make a code runnable only on one computer, you can bind it to a unique hardware or system property that doesn't change often, such as:

MAC Address (from the network interface card)
Hard Drive Serial Number
CPU ID / Motherboard ID
UUID of the System
Below are three common approaches for achieving this in Python. However, similar concepts apply to other programming languages.

1. Binding to MAC Address
The MAC address of the network card is unique to each machine.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
import uuid

def get_mac():
    return hex(uuid.getnode())

def is_authorized():
    allowed_mac = "0x1c697a1bc234"  # Replace with your target machine's MAC
    if get_mac() == allowed_mac:
        print("Authorized: Code is running!")
    else:
        print("Unauthorized: Access denied.")

is_authorized()
Pros: Fairly easy to implement.
Cons: If the network adapter is replaced, the code won't work.
2. Binding to Hard Drive Serial Number
You can retrieve the serial number of the primary hard disk.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
import subprocess

def get_hdd_serial():
    result = subprocess.run(['wmic', 'diskdrive', 'get', 'serialnumber'], 
                            capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout.splitlines()[1].strip()

def is_authorized():
    allowed_serial = "WD-WCC6Y0PXU6HJ"  # Replace with your HDD serial number
    if get_hdd_serial() == allowed_serial:
        print("Authorized: Code is running!")
    else:
        print("Unauthorized: Access denied.")

is_authorized()
Pros: Tied to hardware that rarely changes.
Cons: Not cross-platform (this example is Windows-specific).
3. Binding to System UUID
The UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is tied to the machine’s hardware or operating system.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
import subprocess

def get_uuid():
    result = subprocess.run(['wmic', 'csproduct', 'get', 'UUID'], 
                            capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout.splitlines()[1].strip()

def is_authorized():
    allowed_uuid = "12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef"  # Replace with your machine's UUID
    if get_uuid() == allowed_uuid:
        print("Authorized: Code is running!")
    else:
        print("Unauthorized: Access denied.")

is_authorized()
Pros: More robust identifier.
Cons: UUID can be reset in some cases, such as reinstalling the OS.
Obfuscation and Security Tips
Encryption: Store the allowed ID (MAC, UUID, etc.) in an encrypted form to prevent tampering.
Anti-Tamper Mechanisms: Use techniques like checksum verification to detect code modification.
Remote Validation: If feasible, perform a remote check by contacting a server to verify the hardware.
Caveats
Virtual Machines: Hardware identifiers might differ or can be faked if the code runs on a VM.
User Permissions: Some hardware identifiers require administrative privileges to read.
Changing Hardware: A replacement of the bound hardware (e.g., new NIC or hard drive) will lock the user out.
These methods provide simple but not bulletproof protection. For higher security, combine multiple hardware identifiers or validate on a remote server.

how to you bind the mac address in c

In C, you can bind your code to a MAC address by retrieving it from the network interface and comparing it with a hardcoded, allowed MAC address. Here’s a step-by-step approach along with the code.

1. Code to Retrieve the MAC Address (Linux / Unix / Windows)
On Linux / Unix: Use the <net/if.h> and <sys/ioctl.h> libraries to fetch the MAC address.
On Windows: Use the iphlpapi.h library to achieve the same.
Below is an example focused on Linux, but I’ll give Windows hints as well.

C Code Example (Linux / Unix)
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <net/if.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

#define INTERFACE "eth0"  // Change to the correct network interface (e.g., wlan0 for Wi-Fi)

void get_mac_address(unsigned char *mac) {
    struct ifreq ifr;
    int sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

    if (sock < 0) {
        perror("Socket error");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    strncpy(ifr.ifr_name, INTERFACE, IFNAMSIZ - 1);
    if (ioctl(sock, SIOCGIFHWADDR, &ifr) < 0) {
        perror("IOCTL error");
        close(sock);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    close(sock);
    memcpy(mac, ifr.ifr_hwaddr.sa_data, 6);
}

int is_authorized() {
    unsigned char mac[6];
    unsigned char allowed_mac[6] = {0x1c, 0x69, 0x7a, 0x1b, 0xc2, 0x34};  // Replace with your target MAC

    get_mac_address(mac);

    printf("Current MAC: %02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x\n",
           mac[0], mac[1], mac[2], mac[3], mac[4], mac[5]);

    if (memcmp(mac, allowed_mac, 6) == 0) {
        printf("Authorized: Code is running!\n");
        return 1;
    } else {
        printf("Unauthorized: Access denied.\n");
        return 0;
    }
}

int main() {
    if (is_authorized()) {
        // Proceed with the rest of the program
        printf("Executing secure code...\n");
    } else {
        // Exit or restrict access
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    return 0;
}
Explanation
Creating a socket: The socket() function creates a socket to communicate with the network interface.
ioctl() call: We use the ioctl() system call with SIOCGIFHWADDR to get the hardware address of the specified interface (e.g., eth0 or wlan0).
Comparing MAC addresses: The memcmp() function compares the current MAC address with a predefined allowed one.
Hardcoded MAC: You need to replace allowed_mac with the MAC address of the machine you want to authorize.
Compiling and Running on Linux
bash
Copy code
gcc mac_bind.c -o mac_bind
sudo ./mac_bind
Note: You need sudo permissions to access the MAC address.
Windows Implementation Hint
On Windows, you can use the GetAdaptersInfo() function from the iphlpapi.h library to retrieve the MAC address. The logic is similar: fetch the MAC, compare it with a hardcoded one, and authorize or deny access accordingly.

Security Considerations
Obfuscation: Hardcoding the MAC address makes it easy to reverse-engineer. Consider using encryption or remote validation.
Interface Selection: If the user switches network interfaces, the MAC might change. Handle this carefully.
This approach provides basic protection, but for more security, consider using multiple hardware identifiers or network-based validation.
