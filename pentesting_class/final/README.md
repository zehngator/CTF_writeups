## trans-shell Input Exploit
SY421 Final Project--exploit for trans-shell 


## Overview

The trans-shell Input Exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability stemming from the user input usage of the trans-shell ./trans command. The program executes when the user types ./trans (word or phrase) and translates the word or phrase from an automatically recognized language to english. It also provides some other information surrounding the word or phrase. Ultimately, the trans-shell program harbors vulnerabilities when it comes to handling a user input beginning with https://. Web pages can be opened automatically after such an input is provided. This exposes users to potentially hazardous websites should a malicious url be entered and then opened. Additionally, users could be auto logged in to different sites using cookies without a username or password required.


## Details / Method

1. **Initial Access/Discovery**: We downloaded and installed the requirements and program. Since outputs of the program could only be seen after providing user input, we tested sending large inputs, format strings, and finally urls. When inputting a url, we found that the program would automatically open up the url in a browser.

2. **Exploit**: A url with malicious code (ex: javascript) or any automatically executing code could be used to cause damage to the program or a user's computer. Another option could be to have a website mirroring a common site, such as google, asking a user to sign-in to continue using the program.

3. **Exploit example: Shell Execution**: Experienced attackers could utilize php code and the Apache web server to create a shell on a hosts computer when a url with the code is sent.

4. **Exploit example: Privilege Escalation**: After gaining access to a shell on a user's host, attackers can achieve privilege escalation using a variety of methods, especially if the web page that is opened causes executables to be downloaded to the user's computer.


## Findings
**Noticed it received its responses from a website in order to get a response

- **Lack of Input Sanitization**: Any input that started with https:// would cause the browser to open a tab.
- **Similar to an Open Redirect Vulnerability**


## Mitigation

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Either ensure urls are not entered or remove what would cause a url to be opened ('https://') before the main code executes.

2. **Patch/Update**: Quickly update/patch the code once a vulnerability is known (such as this one as outlined above).

3. **Access Controls/Least Privilege**: Ensure the program does not have permissions do perform actions such as open a url.
