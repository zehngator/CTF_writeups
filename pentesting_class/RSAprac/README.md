## How to solve RSA problem
* m = mod(n)
* n = 2 very large prime numbers multipled together
* e = the encrypting factor to bring m to a expontent
* d = (p,q,e) 
* p,q = the two prime numbers that are multipled
* theta(n) = p-1,q-1

Number we want to encrypt 
> Needs to be less that n 
> 0<m<n  

Cipher test -> m^e % n

decrypt Plaintext -> c^d % n

Given: p, e, n, ct

pt = ct ^ d % n 

must find q fist

q = n // p

put the numbers thorgh a calculate d program

then put the number spat out into bytes
