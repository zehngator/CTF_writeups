## CTF: Bandit 2025
Challenge: Bandit level 12

Category:  linex

Points:

Difficulty: Introductory

## Instructions
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)


## Solution
Need to undo the hex dump and then undo all of the compressions
undo hexdump use: xxd -r data.txt new.txt
find what compression type each is: file new.txt
for gzip: gzip -d new.gz (needs to have gz at the end of the filename)
for bzip2: bzip2 -d new.bz2 (don't know if the bz2 is nessicery but it is useful)
for tar: tar -xvf filename
repeat untill get ascii text for file type
