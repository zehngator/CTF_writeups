## CTF: Bandit 2025
Challenge: Bandit level 23

Category:  linex

Points:

Difficulty: Introductory

## Instructions
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦


## Solution
!/bin/bash                                                                                                           
source_file = "/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24"                                                                             
go_here = "/tmp/tmp.UmYJ3tvjPu"                                                                             
                                                                                                                
cp "$source_file" "$go_here"     
 
------------------------------------------
!/bin/bash                              
source_file = "/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24"
                                   
go_here = "/tmp/tmp.UmYJ3tvjPu/work"
                                
cat "$source_file" > "$go_here" 
------------------------------------------
!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.UmyJ3tvPu/band24pass
The final iteration is the one that worked. The top didn't work since I only had read privlages on bandit24 and the middle one I think will work if I rembered to change the chmod on the shell file. This copyed the pass word into a directory that bandit 23 could read.
