Category:  linex

Points:

Difficulty: Introductory

## Instructions
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).


## Solution
Find a way to make a port listen and give it the password to use the given progarm on 
to make port listen and give line use: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit_20 | nc -l &
This cause the port to open and listen as well as giving it the proper line.
& = sending the code to work in the background
Made the mistake of not reading properly i thought the port we were supossed to use was on nmap but I had to make one listen ask it for the password.
