Challenge: Bandit level 19

Category:  linex

Points:

Difficulty: Introductory

## Instructions
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.


## Solution
Find a way to read the file in /etc/bandit_pass while acting like bandit20

This gives you permission to read the file and opens it
