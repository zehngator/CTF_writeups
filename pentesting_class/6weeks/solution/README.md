## CTF: 6 week assignment AY25
Challenge: Read Between the files

Category:  crypto

Points: 200

Difficulty:  Intermediate

## Instructions

Can you find the flag that is hidden among the [files](./6weeks/challenge). A key is safer hidden in many different files right?                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Hint:  
1. I wonder why there's so many files?
2. What else do the files tell you? 
3. You should ASCII round.

## Solution
* alot of different files

    * They appear to be encoded

    * all read only files  

Bring them all together into a [file](holding2) I can edit  

    cat ./* > holding
*  appear to be rol13ed
* some capital letters among them see if they mean anything

Make a [code](findUpper.py) to find all the uppercase letters and print them out

* Upper case message
> EVTUGONEAJEBATUBEFR
* Rol13ed
> RIGHTBARNWRONGHORSE

Seems to be on the right track just looking at the wrong thing

* checking the size of file to see if it has anything to do with it
    * sizes appear to all be in ascii range

Put all the sizes into a [file](holding)

    ls -l > holding


after isolating the sizes trying to convert it into ascii using this [code](conascii.py)
* after converting ascii result

## Flag

mattCTF{R3ad_Be1*(weN_T43_Fi^@#$5}


## Mitigation
In order to hide a key among many files it is best to prbably encrypt the key first before you it is spread across the files. While it does make it more secure spreading it across the files having it in the open among the files can be a risk.
